## Solution 1: Disable Ad Blocker on PayPal

Sometimes, PayPal's security checks can be disrupted by ad blockers. Follow these steps to disable your ad blocker for PayPal:

1. **Open the PayPal website**: Go to [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com).
2. **Disable the Ad Blocker**:
   - If you use a browser extension like AdBlock, click on the extension icon.
   - Select **Pause on this site** or **Disable on PayPal.com**.
3. **Reload the page**: Refresh your browser and try logging in again.

## Solution 2: Disable DNS Protection or Secure DNS

If you have DNS protection or secure DNS services (e.g., Cloudflare, OpenDNS, etc.) enabled, they may interfere with PayPal's verification process.

1. **Check your DNS protection settings**:
   - If you're using a browser extension, VPN, or security software that includes DNS protection, temporarily disable it.
   - For Cloudflare or OpenDNS users, revert to your default DNS settings or disable the secure DNS feature.
2. **Try logging in again** after disabling DNS protection.

## Additional Tips:
- Make sure your browser is up-to-date.
- Clear your browser’s cache and cookies, then attempt to log in.
